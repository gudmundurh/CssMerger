h2. CSS Merger

The merger follows CSS @import statements and merges imported files into the main file. This allows for dividing CSS files into manageable logical units, but serving a single CSS file at production, thus not sacrifying performance.

A simple command line application is included (CssMergerApp), but the merger can also be used programatically, most easily by referencing CssMerger and writing

<pre>
CssMerger.MergeCss(inputFilename, outputFilename);
</pre>

h2. Notes on @import

Internet Explorer only allows for 32 @import's in each file. Also, although I've not verified it, it only allows for 3 or 4 levels of nested inheritance. This applies at least to versions 6 and 7. Luckily, thanks to the merging process, this should only be problem while developing.
