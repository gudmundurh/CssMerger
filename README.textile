h2. CSS Merger

The merger follows CSS @import statements and merges imported files into the main file. This allows for dividing CSS files into manageable logical units, but serving a single CSS file at production, thus not sacrifying performance.

The merger takes care to rewrite relative paths to images.

A simple command line application is included (CssMergerApp), but the merger can also be used programatically, most easily by referencing CssMerger and writing

<pre>
new CssMerger().MergeCss(inputFilename, outputFilename);
</pre>

h2. Notes on @import

Internet Explorer only allows for 32 @import's in each file. Also, it supposedly only allows for 3 or 4 levels of nested inheritance. This applies at least to versions 6 and 7. Luckily, thanks to the merging process, this should only be problem while developing.

h2. TODO

* Add support for absolute paths to CSS files. This though requires the merger to know the web site's root, which is doesn't need currently.
* Make the command line app more intelligent.
